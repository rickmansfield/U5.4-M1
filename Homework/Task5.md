# Unit 5.4 M1 Task 5

## Instructions
- You are given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that contains N nodes.

- Write a function that can find all the possible paths from node 0 to node N - 1.

- graph[a] is a list of all nodes b for which the edge a -> b exists.

## Example
```
Input: graph = [[1, 2],[3],[3],[4],[]]
Output: [[0,1,3,4], [0,2,3,4]]
```

- The results must be returned in sorted order. You can use any built-in sort method on the results array at the end of your function before returning.

- [execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)

- [input] array.array.integer graph

- [output] array.array.integer
